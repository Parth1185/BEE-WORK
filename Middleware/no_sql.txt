                **MongoDB**
1. Collections:  there are different collections, data is added in collections , just like tables in SQL data is added in tables
2. Documents: an object which has key-value pair and this document is added in collections, it is a record
3. Mongo Shell: it is a command line interface ti interact with mongodb database... data added through command line in MySQL, but for adding data through command in MongoDB
it is opened through a command "mongosh"

MongoDB command

1. show db  : shows all the database list
2. use `db_name` : switch to a particular database, if not created, it will create a new db and switch to it
3. show collections : shows all collections
                ------  insertOne
4. insert   ---|
                ------  insertMany

                db.collection_name.insertOne(   )   //if not created, it will create a new collection and add data
